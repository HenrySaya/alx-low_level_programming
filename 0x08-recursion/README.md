## 0-puts_recursion.c
In this first task we put our recursion knowledge to test by building a function prints a string, followed by a new line

## 1-print_rev_recursion.c
Applying recursive functions to generally print a reversed string

##  2-strlen_recursion.c
This is a recursive function that finds out the length of a string

## 3-factorial.c
In this program we use recursion to fnd factorial of numbers
