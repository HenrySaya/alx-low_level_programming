## 0x14-bit_manipulation
This project will take a look at bit manipulation techniques

## main.h
This header file does contain all the function prototypes

## 0-binary_uint.c
a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

## 1-print_binary.c
a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

## 2-get_bit.c
 a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

## 3-set_bit.c
a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

## 4-clear_bit.c
a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

## 5-flip_bits.c
 a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
