## 0x14-bit_manipulation
This project will take a look at bit manipulation techniques

## main.h
This header file does contain all the function prototypes

## 0-binary_uint.c
a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

## 1-print_binary.c
a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
