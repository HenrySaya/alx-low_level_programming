## 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
More pointers, arrays and strings

## 0x07. C
even more pointers, arrays and strings

## 0x08. C
Recursion - repeating items in a self similar way

## 0x0A. C
argc argv

## 0x0B. C
Took time to go through malloc

More malloc, free

## 0x0D-preprocessor
This time round focused onpre-processors

## 0x0E-structures_typedef

##0x0F. C - Function pointers
Focused a  little on function pointers

## 0x12. c Singly linked lists
Checked the difeerencs of array and linked list like how to perform insertion and deletion operations it is better to use the linked list
