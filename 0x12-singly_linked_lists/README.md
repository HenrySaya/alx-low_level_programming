## 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
In this project I take you through single linked lits in C in the following projects.

## _putchar.c
This file contains the putchar function as we are going to use it more than the printf function.

## lists.h
This file contains the different prototypes that are usd across different test files.

## Test
This folder contains all the test files used to compile each and every file we created in this project

## 0-print_list.c
This file is of a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
list_t is the data structure I employed to create the single linked list.
This file was tested against the 0-main.c file after compilation and in this function we used the printf.
