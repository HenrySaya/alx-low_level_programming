## 0x12.C - Singly Linked lists
In this project I declared, Initialised, Accesed and traversed(Only forward movement) and deleted elements in a single linked list which is a data structure which allows elements to be added indefinetely as we see in this project as we perform insertion(add elements) indefinetely as compared to arrrays.This factor makes it expensive to use arrays when there is a data structure like linked lists; for deletion and insertion.

## lists.h
This is a header file that contains all the prototypes and template used in the functions and accessed within out test files and as we compile the preprocessor fetches the relevant prototype and template that is called by the function.

## 0-print_list.c
This is  a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
Tested this function after compiling with file 0-main.c.

## 1-list_len.c
This is a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
Tested this function after compiling with file 1-main.c.

## 2-add_node.c
This is a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
Tested this function after compiling with file 2-main.c.

## 3-add_node_end.c
This is  a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list
Tested this function after compiling with file 3-main.c.

## 4-free_list.c
This is a function that frees a list_t list.
Tested this function after compiling with file 4-main.c.
