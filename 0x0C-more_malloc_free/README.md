# . C - More malloc, free
Introduction
This project focuses on memory management in C programming, specifically on the usage of malloc and free functions. It includes various tasks aimed at enhancing your proficiency in dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

# Files
## 0-malloc_checked.c
This file contains a function that allocates memory using malloc.

Function Prototype
void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);
Returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
If malloc fails, the malloc_checked function will cause normal process termination with a status value of 98.

## main.h
This header file contains the function prototypes used in this project.

## _putchar.c
This file provides the implementation for the _putchar function, which writes a character to the standard output.

Function Prototype
int _putchar(char c);

Returns the number of characters written or -1 on error.
